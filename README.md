# IR-Evaluation
Trec Evaluation of ranked documents retrieved by searching on ElasticSearch Index
- For every query on ES index, computed R-precision, Average Precision, nDCG, precision@k and recall@k and F1@k (k=5,10, 20, 50, 100) to     check the effectiveness of the retrieval.
- URL Http get and put request for to and fro data exchange with elastic search using REST API.
- Created precision-recall plot using matplotlib.pyplot (MATLAB-like plotting framework)
